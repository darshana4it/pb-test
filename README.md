# PB Tech Assigmnent
## Introduction
An assignment written for a technical evaluation. The scope is to build a clickthrough demo of a single page website for a photobook checkout using HTML5 & CSS3.

The core is written in HTML5, Sass and jQuery. Sass is written to reuse using a combination of SMACSS & atomic design principles. All the custom plugins used in the code are written from scratch using jQuery & Modernizr. Custom plugins include,
 - Switchable card-based content manager for mobile
 - Turnable photobook (WIP)

### Running the code
```git clone https://github.com/darshana4it/pb-test.git
cd pb-test
npm install
sass --no-source-map --update sass:css --style compressed
```
